Each piece is carefully cleaned and deveined, saving you prep time in the kitchen. Prawns are an extremely versatile seafood and absorb marinades beautifully for rich flavor. They can be cooked whole or shelled and are perfect for grilling, frying, or curries. A staple in seafood kitchens, ideal for quick meals or gourmet dishes.",
    "details": {
      "appearance": {

There are no black spots or discolorations along the body or tail. The shell appears smooth and intact with no cracks. Uniform coloring is a sign of high-quality storage and immediate harvest.",
        "shape": "Each prawn has a long, gently curved body segmented into a head, torso, and tail. Legs, antennae, and tail fans are visible on unpeeled varieties. The tail curls inward when cooked, making them easier to pick and eat. They are typically 2–3 inches long, with a streamlined structure. Shape remains intact through cooking due to firm muscle texture.",
        "seeds": "Not applicable, as prawns are aquatic shellfish and do not contain seeds. Their internal organs are often removed during deveining. The meat is solid and uniform without any fibrous inclusions. Any gritty texture suggests improper cleaning, which is avoided in our handling. Only clean, boneless meat is present once peeled.",
        "freshness": "Prawns are caught early in the day and chilled immediately on boats. After cleaning, they are packed and shipped in under 6 hours. Shells remain firm to the touch and bodies spring back slightly. There is no strong or ammonia-like smell, just a light marine scent. Proper cold chain logistics ensure safe and fresh delivery."

Excellent for both spicy and subtle preparations. Great in both dry and gravy-based recipes. Texture remains soft but not mushy if cooked correctly.",
        "aroma": "Raw prawns have a light oceanic smell, not overly fishy or strong. Once cooked, they release a rich and savory aroma that fills the kitchen. Especially aromatic when sautéed in butter, garlic, or spices. The smell is inviting and distinctly coastal. Best enjoyed fresh to retain its pleasant aroma profile."

      "nutrition": {
        "vitaminC": "Not a significant source, but great when paired with lemon or green veggies. Works well in balanced meals rich in Vitamin C. Prawns themselves are loaded with micronutrients. Key vitamins include B12 and D along with trace minerals. They are low in carbs and rich in essential amino acids.",
        "fiber": "As with all meats and seafood, prawns contain no dietary fiber. Combine with fibrous vegetables for a more complete meal. Fiber may be added via cooking ingredients like onions or greens. Not a natural fiber source on their own. Great for low-carb diets when fiber is balanced elsewhere.",
        "otherNutrients": "Excellent source of lean protein, selenium, and phosphorus. Contains omega-3 fatty acids which help with heart and brain health. Low in saturated fat compared to other animal proteins. Boosts metabolism and supports immune function. Suitable for keto and paleo dietary plans.",
        "calories": "Approximately 100 kcal per 100g serving. Low calorie but nutrient-dense, making it ideal for weight-conscious diets. Caloric count varies slightly depending on preparation style. Adds richness to meals without overwhelming calorie content. Offers high satiety despite light profile."

        "culinary": "Commonly used in biryani, soups, seafood salads, and spring rolls. Also used in international dishes like paella, scampi, and Thai curries.

      "shape": "This cut is recognizable by its T-bone in the center separating two distinct sides: the tenderloin and the strip loin. It's typically 1 to 1.5 inches thick and cut into a broad, symmetrical shape. The muscle edges are clean and defined. The tenderloin side is smaller and rounder, while the strip is longer and flatter. Great for center-plate presentation.",
      "seeds": "Being a beef product, the steak naturally has no seeds. The only hard part is the T-shaped bone which adds flavor and moisture during cooking. There are no foreign particles or bone fragments. The meat is completely seed-free. Muscle tissue is dense and uniform.",

      "fiber": "T-Bone steak contains no dietary fiber, like all animal products. Fiber should be supplemented through whole grains, leafy greens, or legumes. A well-rounded meal includes fiber to aid digestion. Steak alone does not fulfill fiber requirements. Pairing matters for dietary completeness.",

    "uses": {
      "fresh": "Let the steak rest at room temperature before searing. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of oil. Best cooked medium-rare to medium to retain juiciness. Rest 5–10 minutes after cooking to redistribute juices. Serve with a compound butter or simple pan sauce.",
      "culinary": "Perfect for grilling, broiling, or cast-iron searing. Works well in surf and turf combinations. Common in American, European, and steakhouse menus. Can be marinated for extra depth or dry-rubbed for crust. Great with mashed potatoes, asparagus, or herbed rice."

The tart shell forms a shallow cup with a scalloped or smooth edge. Fruits are artistically arranged on top for symmetry. Uniform size ensures neat display and consistent servings.",
      "seeds": "Natural seeds may be present in strawberries, kiwis, or grapes. These seeds are edible and soft, contributing minimal texture. Tart base and custard contain no added seeds or grains. Quality control ensures no hard pits or large seeds remain. Suitable for those comfortable with fresh fruit elements.",
      "freshness": "Made fresh daily using chilled custard and ripe seasonal fruit. Glaze preserves moisture and shine while preventing oxidation. Pastry remains crisp if stored correctly and consumed within 24 hours. Fruits retain vibrant color and firm texture when fresh. Signs of staleness include soggy base or wilted fruit slices."

    "tasteAndAroma": {
      "flavor": "Combines a sweet, buttery pastry with smooth vanilla custard and juicy fresh fruits. Each bite delivers a creamy, fruity burst balanced by the rich crust. Natural tartness from berries contrasts beautifully with the sweet glaze. Flavor complexity varies with the fruit combination. Appeals to both classic dessert lovers and fruit-forward palates.",
      "aroma": "Aromas include hints of vanilla, buttery crust, and fresh fruit. The fragrance is delicate but appealing, particularly when freshly prepared. No artificial or overpowering scents — just natural sweetness and dairy richness. Slight citrus or berry scent may rise depending on the topping. Best enjoyed soon after preparation for full aromatic impact."
    },
    "nutrition": {
      "vitaminC": "Fruits on top provide a moderate dose of vitamin C, especially strawberries, kiwi, and citrus slices. Vitamin C supports immunity and skin health. The custard and tart shell themselves contain none. Combining tart with citrus juice enhances this benefit. Great as a dessert with light nutritional bonus from fruit.",
      "fiber": "The fruit topping offers a small amount of dietary fiber, depending on type and quantity. Crust and custard contain little to no fiber. Not a high-fiber item but more fibrous than plain pastries. Adding more berries can increase the fiber value slightly. Pair with tea or coffee for easier digestion.",
      "otherNutrients": "Provides calcium, eggs, and dairy-based proteins from the custard. Also contains carbs, sugar, and a small amount of fat from the tart shell. Fruit contributes antioxidants and natural sugars. Not meant for nutrient-dense consumption but delivers energy and delight. Good for occasional indulgence rather than staple nutrition.",
      "calories": "Each tart contains around 100–120 kcal, depending on size and fruit content. Light enough for guilt-free dessert or snack. Multiple pieces may increase caloric intake quickly. Sweet but portion-controlled treat. Moderate in fats and sugars compared to full-sized pastries."
    },
    "uses": {
      "fresh": "Best served chilled as a dessert or mid-day sweet. Ideal for parties, weddings, brunch platters, or elegant snack boxes. Tarts are often served on decorative trays or wrapped in paper cups. Serve alongside tea, coffee, or sparkling drinks. Consume soon after plating to maintain crispness and flavor.",
      "culinary": "Great addition to dessert buffets, afternoon tea spreads, or boxed bakery assortments. Can be elevated with edible flowers or fine chocolate shavings. Adaptable to seasonal fruit availability for creative presentation. Popular in patisseries, catering menus, and café counters. Easy to scale up for events or plated dining."
    },
    "storage": {
      "refrigeration": "Must be stored in refrigeration at 4°C or lower. Best consumed within 24–36 hours to maintain quality. Do not freeze, as custard may separate and crust soften. Keep covered in airtight containers to prevent drying. Avoid stacking to protect fruit toppings.",
      "humidity": "Keep in low-humidity environments to preserve crust texture. Excess moisture can make the tart base soggy. Fruit toppings should be kept dry and chilled until serving. Use absorbent liners or ventilated trays when storing. Avoid condensation by opening lids gradually when removing from cold."
